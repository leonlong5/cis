              Describing words describe something. They modify something. Adjectives are one type of describing word that are commonly used. They are used to describe a noun or a pronoun. Adverbs are second type of descriptive word. They are used to describe a verb or an adverb. The pages on this site are organized by a word’s first letter. This is just demo for displaying the layout.
